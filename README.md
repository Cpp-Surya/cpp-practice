Modern C++ began in 2011 with the release of the C++11 standard. It represents the language towards writing safer, cleaner, and more expressive code. This repository covers practice examples of most popular features of Modern C++.

## C++11(The Start of Modern C++)

Released in 2011 -> The big shift from "old C++" to "modern style."<br>

* **Auto type deduction**<br>
    Automatically deduce the type of a variable.<br>

* **Smart pointers**<br>
    Automatic memory management, avoiding memory leaks.<br>

* **Lambda expressions**<br>
    Creates small, anonymous functions right where you need them.<br>

* **Range based for loop**<br>
    A much simpler way to loop through element in a container.<br>

* **Move semantics**<br>
    Efficiently "moves" resources from one object to another instead of making an expensive copy.<br>

* **nullptr**<br>
    Replaces NULL with a safer type.<br>

* **Type-Traits**<br>
    Checks about types at compile-time and allows us to manipulate them.

## C++14(Small improvements)

Smaller update focused on making C++11 features even better.<br>

* **Generic Lambdas**<br>
    We can use auto for parameters in a lambda, making it work with different datatypes.<br>

* **Return type deduction**<br>
    No need to write return type for functions if obvious.<br>

## C++17(Cleaner, safer code)

This release added major new library features for modern programming tasks.<br>

* **if/switch with initializer**<br>
    Declare variable inside if/switch.<br>

* **Structured bindings**<br>
    Unpack tuple-like objects.<br>

* **std::optional**<br>
    Represents a value that may or may not exist.<br>

* **std::variant**<br>
    Type-safe union.<br>

* **std::string_view**<br>
    Lightweight string reference(no copy).<br>

## C++20(Huge step forward)

This is another massive release with features that are reshaping how C++ is written.<br>

* **Concepts**<br>
    Type constraints for templates.<br>

* **Ranges**<br>
    Easier container operations.<br>

* **Coroutines**<br>
    Async programming made easy.<br>

* **Modules**<br>
    Faster & cleaner imports.<br>

## C++23(Refinements & quality-of-life)

The latest standard adds more high-value library features.<br>

* **std::expected**<br>
    Better error handling.<br>

* **Ranges improvements**<br>
    Even richer range utilities.<br>

* **print**<br>
    Easier printing.<br>
